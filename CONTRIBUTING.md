## Architecture Notes

- **core_layout**: Pure layout logic, no platform dependencies. Should be easily testable.
- **platform_win32**: All Windows API calls go here. Uses `windows-rs` crate.
- **daemon**: Orchestrates everything. Handles events, manages state, applies layouts.
- **cli**: Thin client that sends commands to the daemon via IPC.
